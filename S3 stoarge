S3 ( simple storage service ) = S3 is object level storage and access by http or https internet and you can share this storage in region or different region and we can can not install opearting system in bucket 
# S3 has three backup copy and data storage in bucket maximum capacity of a bucket is 5 TB and bucket owner not transfer and maximum bucket is 100
# Object level storage = it store file/data and its metadata and it have gobal unique id 
# Block level storage = all data divide into equal blocks then its store in EBS storage  

S3 BUCKET SUB RESOURCES
Lifecycle = To decide on obect lifecycle management ( you set after n day these data go on another storage and current data only store here)
Website = to hep configurate related static website hosted
versioning = go commit after perivous version but you have enable this but after enable we can disable version but we can suspend for sometime versioning
Access control list = security how access your bucket or not and you can add password
MFA(Multifactor authentication delete) = If you enable this, someone try to delete your data base then its need 6 didgit code need that's inside your mobile
multi path upload api = data store in parts, its store data fastly

S3 TYPE OF SECUIRTY
S3-Standed = its data accessed frequently and it can be encrypt your data 
S3-IA = its data accessed less frequently but required access when we need and it can be encrypt your data 
S3 Intelligent Tiering = its used transfer automatically most cost data base to less data base
Amazon one-zone IA = its data accessed less frequently but required access when we need and but it des not three backup copy
S3 Glacier = it used data store long time and data retrieval option that few minutes to hours and it can be encrypt your data 
S3 Glacier Deep archive = it used data store long time and less data usage store here 

CREATING S3 STORAGE
S3 BUCKET = create bucket -> upload data
# you can access this data by click url
# it is used for stored data
# Version Enable = recover your old data (meaning pervious version data)
version = go on click data -> version
#crossregion replication= It is used for create backup data(it create copy data on differnet region automatic)

S3 CLI
Search in google aws cli and download 64 or 32 bit
go on laptop cmd enter = aws configure
# you need access ID and key go on aws account go up on right aws (where your name write) and click on My security creaditonal click create new access key and download
inside file you have id and key then write cmd click enter 2 times
aws s3 ls         # list all s3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://bucket_name                  # create bucket but unique bucket name and mb = make bucket
aws rb s3://backet_name                     # remove bucket
# attach laptop folder with s3 bucket
firstly go in folder which you want sync
aws s3 sync . s3//bucket_name               # attach laptop folder with s3 bucket and all data in folder go in bucket
aws s3 sync s3://bucket_name .              # all data from bucket add in folder

S3 versioning enable
#recover your old data (meaning pervious version data)
clicket on bucket -> properties -> versioning -> enable or suspend
# Once enable versioning you can't disbale versioning
# if delete data mistakely then you can retrive data by versioning
clicket on bucket -> versioN -> show -> click on file -> action - delete                    # after delete in come data to bucket

S3 CROSSREGION REPLIACTION
# It is used for create backup data(it create copy data on differnet region automatic)
creat two bucket in differnet region -> versioning enable -> managment -> replication -> add rule (clicket entire bucket) -> next -> destination (select your another bucket) -> select storage -> IAM role (for access) -> save
# this is all steps done in one main bucket
# version enable is important for crossregion replication

LIFECYCLE
# To decide on obect lifecycle management ( you set after some day these data go on another storage type and current data only store here)
clicket on bucket -> managment -> lifecycle -> add lifecycle rule -> enter name and all object(if select tag which data has tag only those use ) -> current and pervious version (you can select both and only one) ADD TRANSITION FOR BOTH CURRENT AND PERVIOUS (enter in which storage where your transfer and select day after go) -> how man days after your permentaly delete data and marker delete select
# marker = its after enable it market start store your data for restore
